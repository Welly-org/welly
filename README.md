# Welly
## Project Description 📜
Welly is a platform that encourages you and your friends to invest in your self-care together. Set goals as a group and make posts that inspire each other. Be a part of lasting communities centered around your wellness!

## How to run this project ⚙️
You will need to run Welly on two separate local ports to host both the front and the back ends. To do this, cd into the project folder and open two terminal windows. In one type 
`cd client`
and then 
`npm run dev`
in the second terminal, type 
`cd server`
and then 
`npm run start `
By default, these commands will run the frontend on localhost:3000 and the backend API on localhost:4000.
